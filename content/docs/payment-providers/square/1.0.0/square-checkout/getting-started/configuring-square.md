## App Configuration

In order for Vendr to communicate with Square we must first create an App in the Square portal which will provide us with credentials that Vendr can use to authenticate with.

In the sidebar, click the **Apps** heading and then the **Create APP** button providing a name for the app to create.

## Webhook 

In order for Square to notify Vendr of a successful transactions, Square makes use of webhook technology to directly send notifications of the changing statuses of a transaction. By using webhooks it ensures that the system will always be notified of these status changes, even if the customer decides not to return to the store once a transaction is complete.

To register a webhook, in the sidebar of the app dashboard, click the **Webhooks** heading and then the **Add Webhook** button. In the dialog that is displayed, give your webhook a name and enter the Vendr callback URL as follows (replacing the parameters in curly brackets with the corresponding values taken from your store):

````
https://{store_domain}/umbraco/vendr/payment/callback/square-checkout-onetime/{payment_method_id}/
````

From the **Event** list select the following event types:

* `payment.updated`

Click **Save** button at bottom in overlay to register the details for the webhook.

With the webhook created, click the view the details of the webhook in the webhooks list and click the **Show** link next to the **SIGNATURE KEY** to view the webhooks signing secret. Note this down along with the API credentials from earlier as you'll need these in the [Configuring Umbraco](../configuring-umbraco/) section.
