title: Order Calculation State
description: Calculation context in Vendr, the eCommerce solution for Umbraco v8+

When extending the calculation process of Vendr, either by custom [calculators](../calculators/) or custom [pipeline tasks](../pipelines/) there is an important state object that you should be aware of and that is the `OrderCalculation` object.

## The Calculation Process

When an order asks to be re-calculated, this triggers a calculation pipeline which in turn runs a series of calculation tasks and calls a number of extendable calculators in order to work out the orders various prices. Throughout this process Vendr needs to keep track of all these prices as they change, but at the same time it also needs to ensure that the calculation is transactional so that if something goes wrong, we don't want to leave the order in a semi-calculated state. To accomplish both of these requirements we use a temporary state object called `OrderCalculation` to store all this information and then only at the end of the calculation, if everything was successful, do we then copy those calculated prices back to the order.

## Accessing Price Values

Why is this important? Well, in these various calculation extension points Vendr will often pass you **both** an `Order` object and the `OrderCalculation` object. We pass the order so that you can get access to any information held on it that you may need for your calculation, such as any custom properties or customer information, however this shouldn't be used for accessing any price related values of the order.

Why? As mentioned above, in order to maintain data integrity during the calculation process, the order itself is not updated until the very end and so any calculations based on the order entities price values would be based on the orders **previously calculated price values**.
 
In order to base your calculation on the current calculated price values you should instead access the `OrderCalculation` object.

## The OrderCalculation Object

````csharp
public class OrderCalculation
{
    public Dictionary<Guid, OrderLineCalculation> OrderLines { get; }

    public Dictionary<string, Amount> GiftCardAmounts { get; }

    public List<string> FulfilledDiscountCodes { get; }

    public List<FulfilledDiscount> FulfilledDiscounts { get; }

    public TaxRate TaxRate { get; set; }

    public OrderSubtotalPrice SubtotalPrice { get; set; }

    public TaxRate ShippingTaxRate { get; set; }

    public TotalPrice ShippingTotalPrice { get; set; }

    public TaxRate PaymentTaxRate { get; set; }

    public TotalPrice PaymentTotalPrice { get; set; }

    public OrderTotalPrice TotalPrice { get; set; }
}

public class OrderLineCalculation
{
    public Dictionary<Guid, OrderLineCalculation> OrderLines { get; }

    public TaxRate TaxRate { get; set; }

    public OrderLineUnitPrice UnitPrice { get; set; }

    public OrderLineTotalPrice TotalPrice { get; set; }

    public Price RollingSubOrderLinesTotalPrice { get; set; }

    public Price RollingSubOrderLinesTotalDiscountPrice { get; set; }
}
````

From the `OrderCalculation` object you can access the various order prices, including order line calculations. The order line calculations are held in a dictionary where they key is the order lines ID, and the value is an `OrderLineCalculation` object holding the various calculated prices for that order line.

By using the prices from the `OrderCalculation` object you can ensure that your calculation is based on the most up to date values for the order.

If you are performing a calculation and your values is based on another price held on an order, and you have access to an `OrderCalculation` object that isn't `null`, then **always** base your price on the `OrderCalculation` object's price values and only fall back to the order entity if there is no `OrderCalculation` available.
